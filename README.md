# End Police Violence

The creators of this site do not condone or encourage violence.

This site is dedicated to sharing and preserving records of police violence
during the 2020 protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd by ex-cop Derek
Chauvin.

From Martin Luther King Jr.:

> I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain
> conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as
> vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the
> language of the unheard.
